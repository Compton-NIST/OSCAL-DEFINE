# Define: Customer Responsibility Model

> Status: Open

## Problem Statement

This research effort is focused on the creation of a model that supports the ability to export content from the System Security Plan (SSP) for customers to import/reference in a separate System Security Plan. This responsibility model is used to expose only the appropriate and necessary SSP content to a leveraging system, when the leveraging system owner is not entitled to see the entire SSP of the leveraged system.
