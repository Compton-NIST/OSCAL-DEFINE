## About OSCAL DEFINE

OSCAL DEFINE outlines research and educational pursuits in the OSCAL program using an iterative and collaborative approach. The work in this project focuses on the research performed in response to a stated problem.

Our goal is to establish an OSCAL research framework and process that allows the team members assigned to research and educational topics to receive the necessary support in gathering the requirements, analyzing them, identifying use cases, documenting them, generating specifications that support rapid development of prototypes, and serve as a stable catalyst for engineering and development planning, integration, and implementation.

The output of each effort is:

- published in this project, 
- reviewed with the community, 
- used as input to guide the next effort, and 
- provides opportunity to adjust the course as knowledge is acquired.

## Process Overview

**[An Example Research Effort with Spirals can be found here.](getting-started/GUIDED-TOUR.md)**

### Initiation

- A problem, challenge or concern is identified, reviewed and prioritized for Discovery.

### Discovery (Spirals)

- A research effort takes place in increments called spirals.

### Explanation

- Per Spiral:
  - At the end of each Spiral, the information will be committed to the OSCAL DEFINE project.
  - Findings will be presented for feedback and decision-making.
  - When enough knowledge has been gained, a change request issue may be submitted or the development of a solution may begin.
  - Spirals may continue to further define the solution or explore the problem further.
- Per Research Effort, at the end of Discovery:
  - The result may include a new or revised prototype, process or practice.
  - The result should provide enough evidence to be used in engineering or practical application.

## Getting Started

- [Attend the OSCAL DEFINE Meetings](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/contribute/define-meeting/)
- [Review current research efforts](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL-DEFINE/tree/main/research-2023)
- [Open an issue with a problem statement](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL-DEFINE/issues/new)

More documentation can be found in our [Getting Started](getting-started/) folder.  This will guide you through the process and provide information for conducting a successful, collaborative research effort.

## Efforts as a series of Research Spirals

> The process is inspired by [Boehm's *Spiral Model of Software Development and Enhancement*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/59) (with [a good overview in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp22SDTnsQQ)), but adapted to provide knowledge and decision support for new or enhanced OSCAL models.  A Spiral is an iterative, asynchronous effort that allows for research to begin with limited information, and delivers new discoveries and understanding at the end of each spiral.  This input guides ongoing efforts in research, which can in turn guide development activities.
