# Research is essential.

## Our goal is better decision-making. We are seeking:

- **Problem Statements** as catalysts for the future of OSCAL.
- **Documentation** of concepts requiring thought and discovery. 
- **Feedback** as a contribution to the best approach or alternatives.
- **Time** to consider all input and to make informed decisions.
