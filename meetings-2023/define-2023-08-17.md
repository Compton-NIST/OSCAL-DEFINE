# OSCAL DEFINE

## Third Thursday of every month @ 11:00 AM ET

- Summarize current research efforts.
- Present findings from recent efforts.
- Gather feedback and input.

# Discussion is vital.

## Our goal is deeper understanding. Please help us to:

- **Ensure** that everyone feels welcome.
- **Encourage** sharing of individual perspectives and experiences.
- **Allow** everyone space to join in, as well as to finish speaking.
- **Ask** questions that expand ideas or uncover gaps.

# Research is essential.

## Our goal is better decision-making. We are seeking:

- **Problem Statements** as catalysts for the future of OSCAL.
- **Documentation** of concepts requiring thought and discovery. 
- **Feedback** as a contribution to the best approach or alternatives.
- **Time** to consider all input and to make informed decisions.

## Gap Assembly

> Describes state of unmapped controls.

```
gap [0 or 1] :
{
    subject [1]: string,
    A choice of:
        include-controls [1] : { 
            with-child-controls [0 or 1]: token,
            with-ids [0 or 1]: [ … ],
            matching [0 or 1]: [ … ],
        },
        link [1]: {
            href [1]: uri-reference,

# Shared Responsibility

- Currently Drafting [Responsibility][] Changes
  - Normalize `implementation-status` and `export`-able across SSP and CDef.
  - `export` currently renamed to `shared-responsibility`.
  - Will evaluate if/how the changes can be backwards compatible.
- Exploration Examples

# Create an Issue

- Title
- Problem Statement
- https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL-DEFINE/issues/new/choose
- Focus on what is needed.

That is all that is required to get things started!

---

# Spiral Content

## Options
1. **Markdown document in repository.**
*(More complex, requires GitHub knowledge and account)*
2. **Adding sprial template for the issue.** 
*(Less complex, still requires GitHub account)*
3. **Word template under review for attaching to issues.**
*(Low barrier, but requires reformat by team once complete)*

---

# Participation

- Review of the [process][].
- Focus on discussions for topics of interest.
- Word template under review for attaching to issues
- https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL-DEFINE/discussions/categories/research-efforts

[process]: https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL-DEFINE/issues/31
