## Define: Mapping Model Revisions

## Problem

Relates to: OSCAL mapping model support for identifying controls in a catalog that are not mapped OSCAL#1333. All issues related to mapping requirements and feedback need to be consolidated and synthesized. Findings were produced at the end of 2022, but not shared. These need to be summarized as a part of the effort.

## Capability: Gap Specification

```xml
      <map>
        <relationship>superset-of</relationship>
        <source type=”control” ref-id=”cis-12.5”/>
        <source type=”control” ref-id=”cis-12.7”/>
        <target type=”control” ref=”IAM-14”/>
        <target-gap>This describes what additional elements of IAM-14 need to
      be added in order to close the gap.</target-gap>
      </map>
```

- `source-gap` element that describes the gap textually on the source side, when the relationship “subset-of” or “intersects” is used.

- `target-gap` element that describes the gap textually on the target side, when the relationship “superset-of” or “intersects” is used.

## Capability: Additional Relationship Definition

Gap specification seems to support the implication of directionality, and under what conditions this might be supported.  The problem is automated interpretation of the context of the gap - is it not stating what is possible, or stating that it is not possible because of some incompatibility.  If the previous gap tag is supported, it may need a type that can define conditions such as addressable, incompatible, or undetermined.

- Other relationship terms, based on SKOS: 
  - skos:broader
  - skos:narrower
  - skos:related
- https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#semantic-relations

- Directionality of Relationships
  - One way
  - Both ways

Also related: [Issue 1332]*

*(But I think this would be addressed in the gap approach above.)

## Capability: Context of Use

“Explicitly stating the purpose of the map is important to create shared expectations between the creator of the map and the user of the map regarding what the map is intended to accomplish.”
- https://library.ahima.org/doc?oid=58226#.Y1KPqezMLFw


Add a required purpose to mapping assembly, so that each mapping has proper context. This will address the concern stated above. Could be assigned enumerated values rather than an unstructured text field, but the list would need to be determined. (Informational, Translational, etc)

## Capability: Clarity of Ownership

Add the authoritative owner of the source and target.  This would make it clear whether the mapping is completed by an authoritative owner of the source/target, and when a mapping is produced by a third party.

Possibly: mapping.source-resource.responsible-parties
Possibly: mapping.target-resource.responsible-parties

## Capability: Manner of Creation

“Understanding how a mapping was created (e.g. automatically or by a human expert curator) is crucial to interpreting it.”
- https://doi.org/10.1093/database/baac035

Add a provenance for the mapping assembly.
Possibly: source-author, target-author, organization, individual, automation 
Also, if automated, should confidence score be included per SSSOM paper?

## Capability: Explicitly Not Mapped [Issue 1333]

“Must be able to distinguish between absence due to lack of information vs deliberate omission”
- https://doi.org/10.1093/database/baac035

- This could be: not mapped, incomplete, rejected, unmappable, or omitted.
- Could this be stated in a regex, or blanket way?

## Capability: Parameterization and Specification Level of Controls

Considerations for mapping when parameterized statements or controls are mapped to statements or controls with explicitly stated terms.  For example, a requirement for a time interval of inventory review.
