## Define: Mapping Model Revisions

## Problem

Relates to: OSCAL mapping model support for identifying controls in a catalog that are not mapped OSCAL#1333. All issues related to mapping requirements and feedback need to be consolidated and synthesized. Findings were produced at the end of 2022, but not shared. These need to be summarized as a part of the effort.
