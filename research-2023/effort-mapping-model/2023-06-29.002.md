## Define: Mapping Model Qualifier and Provenance Tag Change Requests

## Problem

In the last spiral, there were two assemblies that could support more descriptive mappings, and provide additional context to include gap analysis.  In this spiral, two change requests will be prepared for the OSCAL project to evaluate and fully engineer for implementation into the development/draft version of the control mapping model.
