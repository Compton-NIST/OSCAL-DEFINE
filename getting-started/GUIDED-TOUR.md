# Tour of the Example Research Effort

## Initiation

The research effort issue would have a long life and close only at the full conclusion of the effort and associated spirals.

- [Research Effort Request Issue](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL-DEFINE/issues/1)

This would start the process, and ultimately flow through four steps:

* Step 1: Initiation - Under review and consideration.
* Step 2: Ready to Start - Ready for effort to begin.
* Step 3: Discovery - Actively researching.
* Step 4: Results - Final results being prepared/presented.
* Step 5: Concluded - Effort has ended.

As a part of initiation, the effort would be [linked in the index for the year](../research-example/).

Also, the effort would have a folder of its own, and an associated [README.md](../research-example/2022-07-Customer-Responsibility-Model) with a summary of the effort and status.

## Discovery 

The spiral issues are used to track progress, feedback and concurrence for the increment.

### Spiral 1

- [Spiral 1 Issue](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL-DEFINE/issues/2)
- [Spiral 1 Document](../research-example/2022-07-Customer-Responsibility-Model/2022-07-05.001.md)
  
An initial spiral of work occurs here.  A document is created to track the progress and result of the spiral. This issue has been closed.  It is observed in the Research Effort Issue above.

### Spiral 2

- [Spiral 2 Issue](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL-DEFINE/issues/3)
- [Spiral 2 Document](../research-example/2022-07-Customer-Responsibility-Model/2022-07-05.002.md)

The next spiral of work occurs here. A document is created to track the progress and result of the spiral. This issue is open.  It is observed in the Research Effort Issue above.
